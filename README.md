# Expense-Tracker
Java | JavaFx | OOD


The “Expense Tracker” project is a personal finance management application developed using Java and JavaFX. The goal of the project is to provide users with a simple and powerful tool to manage their expenses, track their income/outcome, and analyze their financial data.
The application allows users to record their expenses by category, amount, date, and custom-defined descriptions. The application also provides a dashboard that displays pie charts to visualize the user's financial data.

The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, which separates the application logic into three distinct layers: the model layer, the view layer, and the controller layer. The model layer is responsible for managing the data and business logic, while the view layer handles the user interface components. The controller layer acts as a bridge between the model and view layers, handling user input and updating the model accordingly.
